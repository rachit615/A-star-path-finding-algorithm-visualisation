# A-star-path-finding-algorithm-visualisation
Build a path finding visualizer tool by implementing A* Search algorithm using Python using Pygame  in a 2-D Grid. 
It will take a starting point and an ending point and take the barrier points and will give the shortest path between these two points. 
 User can do the following operations:- 
          By pressing Space button ,it will give the shortest path. 
          By Right Click it will change the starting and ending points. 
          By Clicking on X button ,it will close the window.
  It uses Heuristics to guide its Search which results in an optimal algorithm to find shortest path between two points.
